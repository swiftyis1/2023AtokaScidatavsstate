# 2023AtokaScidatavsstate

This project analyzes Oklahoma state assessment data to evaluate Atoka High School's performance in the 2023 science exam. It identifies higher-performing schools, highlights magnet schools, and explores potential benchmarks and curricula for further research.

## Overview

The notebook conducts a detailed analysis of the 2023 Oklahoma science assessment results, focusing on:

* Atoka High School's performance relative to other schools
* Identification of magnet schools within the dataset
* Benchmarking schools that outperformed Atoka for future research

## Project Structure

* `2023AtokaScidatavsstate.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis
* `data/`: Directory containing the assessment data files
* `images/`: Folder for storing generated plots and visualizations

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swiftyis1/2023AtokaScidatavsstate.git
   cd 2023AtokaScidatavsstate
   ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `2023AtokaScidatavsstate.ipynb` to explore the analysis.

## Key Findings

* Performance metrics for Atoka HS and statewide comparisons- Atoka above the zscore of 1.
* Identification and performance of magnet schools and charters- Atoka scores were just below many of the top magnets.
* Schools that outperformed Atoka HS, identified for follow-up research

## Tools and Libraries

* Pandas for data manipulation
* NumPy for numerical operations
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for basic plotting
* Plotly for interactive visualizations

## Future Work

* Investigate the curricula of top-performing schools
* Develop benchmarks and improvement strategies for Atoka HS science department
